# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

When there is more than one outcome we need to use conditionals.  For example, if "paid tuition" = true, then "do not send email", otherwise, send email.  

2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?

I would revist the "make pizza" exercise and just simplify it.  It really only needs 2 cups of flour and sauce to make a pizza.  I overcomplicated the code by adding multiple unnecessary steps I think.

3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?

This was something I had already learnded from CodeAcademy so it was nice to have that background.  It made the lesson easy to grasp.
